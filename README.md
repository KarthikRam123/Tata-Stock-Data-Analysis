Implementing Machine learning models including Linear Regression, RNN, KNN and, most successfully, a LSTM deep neural network have been used for stock market 
prediction. Further other Machine learning models such as Sentiment Analysis , Na√Øve Bayes , SVM , Random Forest have been reviewed . The main concept for 
effective stock market prediction is not only to produce the best returns and reduce risk, but also to minimize the wrong stock price forecast.
